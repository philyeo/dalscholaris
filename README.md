SYNOPSIS:
DALscholaris is an android app that allows students or faculty to conduct their research on the go by leveraging on Dalhousie libraryâ€™s subscribed research databases and journals. Users can use the app both on campus and off campus without having to use a vpn connection. Furthermore one can also view the research paper in pdf or word format with added support of zooming into specific paragraphs to enlarge the view for easier reading. The app also allows the user to save or bookmark the document on the phone for later viewing. We find that this will be a useful app for many students and faculty who wants to do their research quick while on the move since most people would have access to a mobile device.
